For my Time Series Analysis project in Business, Data Science, and Economics, I leveraged data from St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) and focused on the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford area (MSA) in Florida. Using Stata, I applied time series analysis tools to forecast the March non-seasonally adjusted estimates for the total employment number and average weekly earnings of private employers.

To achieve accurate forecasts, I employed several techniques such as vselect and rolling windows for model selection. These techniques allowed me to identify the best model and forecast its outcome. Overall, this project aimed to showcase the effectiveness of time series analysis tools in business and economics and provide valuable insights into the future trends of employment and earnings in the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford area.
