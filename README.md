# Time-Series-Analysis
In this project for Time Series Analysis for Business, Data Science, & Economics, I used data from St Louis Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) and am using available data for the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford area (MSA) in Florida. Using Stata this project allows application with time series tools to forecast the March non-seasonally adjusted estimates for the number of total employment for private employers and their average weekly earnings. This project includes the use of vselect and rolling windows for model selection and a forecast of the best model selection.
